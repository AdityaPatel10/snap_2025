This project was submitted by Aditya, Muskan and Suryanshu for Snap Syntax 2025. In this contest, we cloned the frontend of a website using only HTML and CSS. The top section, the navbar is a fixed section at the top. The next component are the cards with image backgrounds, with a video inside each card. This card has a bckground zoom effect on hover. We also have two texts on the left and right of the cards that are sticky to the cards section. Next we have the footer at the bottom of the website.
